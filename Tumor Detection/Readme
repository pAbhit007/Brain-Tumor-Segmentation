Types of brain tumors: Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary tumor
Distribution of slices:
Meningioma: 708 slices
Glioma: 1426 slices
Pituitary tumor: 930 slices
Data format: MATLAB (.mat)
Data split: Split into 4 subsets, each in a separate .zip file, with each .zip file containing 766 slices
Cross-validation: 5-fold cross-validation indices provided
Structure of Each .mat File:

# Each .mat file contains a struct with the following fields for an image:
cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumor
cjdata.PID: Patient ID
cjdata.image: Image data
cjdata.tumorBorder: A vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumor border. Format: [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]
cjdata.tumorMask: A binary image with 1s indicating tumor region
This structure allows for easy access to key information about each image, including its label, patient ID, image data, tumor border coordinates, and tumor mask.
