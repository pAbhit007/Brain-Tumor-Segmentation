The U-Net 3D model is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for volumetric image segmentation.
Instead of 2D convolutions, it uses 3D convolutions, which process volumetric data in three dimensions, capturing spatial hierarchies and context within the entire volume.
It is widely used for 3D segmentation tasks in medical imaging, such as tumor segmentation, organ delineation, and brain lesion detection, due to its ability
to handle the complexity and depth of 3D images.
